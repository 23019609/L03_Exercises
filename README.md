May or may not have created orphaned commits or otherwise just messed up my old repository in general
due to my excessive use of rebase, force push, and hard reset in an attempt to undo and fix some stuff.

After spending way too much time trying to fix the issues instead of focusing on my work,
the reflog has become too lengthy to navigate effectively, and I, kind of, can no longer reset back to a desired previous commit.

Files should be fine but no longer updated.

Created new repository: [C346 L03](https://github.com/23019609/C346_L03).
